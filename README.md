# FolderFileNamesToCSV

I developed this program to help in a file transfer project. We needed to get the folder names and file names of over 30,000 files that we sorted the week before. The program would create a CSV that held the folder names in the first column and the file names in the second column in the specified path. It would also filter out files that did not contain the ".pdf" and ".tiff" file extension names. The next step in the project would be to download all the files we sorted before into one folder and run a script that could copy all files into their respectable folder.
